# CSCE 482: Bike Sharing

This semester we're working with Texas A&M's Transportation Department in order to generate a solution to the existing bike share problem on campus. In specific we're looking at creating a heatmap of both the where rides begin as well as where they end. Furthermore we hope to be able to perform some predictive analysis on the datasets in order to better know when to rebalance bicycles. Finally if time permits, we hope to be able to plan routes for the transportation department to aide them in their rebalancing.
